# Bipper
Tiny application which allow you to register, login, beep (post) some stuff, edit and delete your beeps.

Live Demo here : https://bipperapp.herokuapp.com

To run the app locally:

1)download the source coude or clone it

2)npm install (since I managed to save locally all the needed modules, you just need to hit npm install to get all needed modules)

3)npm start 

That's all

Ps: session is not implemented, if you refresh the page while logged in you'll automatically be logged out.

Ps2: to beep, you must be logged in (register if you don't have an account).

Ps3: you can only delete and edit YOUR OWN BEEPS.
